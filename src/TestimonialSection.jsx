                      The team at EXCELLIS IT worked quickly to get our website
                      online and provided a step-by-step guide to manage our
                      expectations. They were easily contactable and were fast
                      to make amendments ensuring our website was delivered on
                      time and budget. The EXCELLIS team also helped us by
                      providing valuable market insight to assist us in
                      marketing our online services to the public. I would not
                      hesitate to recommend EXCELLIS for anyone requiring
                      assistance with building and marketing a corporate
                      website.
