                  </p>

                  <h4>PAYMENT:</h4>

                  <p>
                    Client agrees to pay Excellis IT the service fee, for any
                    Program or Service Client enrols in, pursuant to the terms
                    of the Payment Plan Client selected, including without
                    limitation, all applicable taxes, if any, in accordance with
                    the billing terms in effect at the time the service fee
                    becomes payable. Client expressly understands, acknowledges
                    and hereby authorizes Excellis IT to automatically charge
                    Client’s credit card or debit Client’s bank account once a
                    month or one time as per the Program requirement.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Client will be charged as soon as they sign up over the
                    phone. Excellis IT also reserves the right to pursue
                    alternative means of payment up to and including debt
                    collection services and customer shall be liable for all
                    collection costs, including without limitation, attorneys’
                    fees.
                  </p>

                  <h4>PAYMENT COLLECTION:</h4>

                  <p>
                    As Excellis IT provides a bill-through service for sponsored
                    listings, the company takes a significant credit risk for
                    each and every Client. Therefore, the Client is responsible
                    to maintain an active and valid payment method on file at
                    all times. If for any reason, Client’s payment method is not
                    available, Excellis IT reserves the right to immediately and
                    temporarily turn off the website, pay-per-click ads,
                    sponsored listings and ongoing or then current production,
                    reporting, or support Services being provided to account. If
                    the payment is not received, Excellis IT reserves the right
                    to terminate the Agreement in full and retain ownership of
                    the web site, or other Services until such time the account
                    has been paid in full. All Term Commitment Terminations will
                    result in an escalation of all fees owed under the Terms of
                    the Agreement. Many clients maintain multiple forms of
                    payment on file to prevent this from occurring.
                    Representations and Warranties Client represents, warrants
                    and covenants that (i) Client has sufficient authority to
                    enter into the Agreement; (ii) Client is a business, not a
                    consumer, and that Client’s use of Excellis IT services is
                    solely for lawful commercial and business purposes; (iii)
                    Client has the necessary rights to provide all information
                    provided under the Agreement for use as described in the
                    Agreement.
